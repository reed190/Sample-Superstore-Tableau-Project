# Sample-Superstore-Tableau-Project

Problem:  
The director of sales wants to compare sales data for various categories of items by region.  This will help the director see the performance of each region and where improvements can be made. The sample superstore dataset will be used for this project (available in files).

Objectives:  
1. Import data source into Tableau.
2. Apply data source filter to entire worksheet to only use data for east and central regions.
3. Create a table for each region that shows sales, max sales, and minimum sales for each category and sums the totals at the bottom.
4. Create a bar graph that shows sales for each region.
5. Create calculated fields for sales per order, # of products per sale, number of customers, number of orders, sum of sales, and first order date.
6. Develop a map display of the east and central regions. 
7. Develop a dashboard that displays the above charts in an easy to read format.

Results and Conclusion
1. The east region performed better on all the calculated fields. 
2. The top and lowest performing sales categories were the same for both the east and central regions.  The top categories were phones followed by chairs, while the lowest categories were fasteners followed by labels.  This makes sense, as phones and chairs can be high priced items, while fasteners and labels are lower priced items.
3. Investigation should be done into why the east region performed better on sales than the central region.
